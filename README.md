# SCP File Transfer
Transferring files such Images, packages or any other files into multiple network devices is time consuming. By running this application, a file gets copied into number of devices seamlessly. SCP is used where the file size is small as it is not capable of transferring larger files. The application is based on OOP concept to provide extendibility by adding functions into the class itself. The application is tested with cisco_ios successfully. Testting with other OS type is going on.
